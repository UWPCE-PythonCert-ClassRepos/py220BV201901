Grading
=======

To grade the assignment:
1. Take a look at the log file created by the student solution, looking for:
- Error message for typo in input JSON file (I added an extra apostrophe somewhere).
- Error message for quantity = 0 in any of the rentals.
- Warning for rentals missing end_date.
- etc.    
2. Run linting using the regular batch file.
