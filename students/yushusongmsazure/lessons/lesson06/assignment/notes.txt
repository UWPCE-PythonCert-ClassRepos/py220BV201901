Step 1: Add logging using a decorator
--The purpose is to calculate how much time spent to run analyze function without doing any improvements.
--The approach was to run poor_perf.py for 10 times and found the average time spent of each run is around 10 seconds.

Step 2: Reduce file I/O time
--Within analyze function, the csv file has been opened/closed 2 times to filful 2 different data analyze processes.
--However, we can combine these 2 processes into 1 file I/O.
--Time reduced by half based on 10 runs.

Step 3: Use a list instead of dictionary to reduce lookup time for year_count
