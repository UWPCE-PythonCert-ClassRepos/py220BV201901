Lesson 8 assignment notes.

Interpreted assignment instructions as follows:
Created 'inventory.py'.  This program contains all functions and U/I.
  
It wasn't clear if add_furniture function should accept a csv file as input?
I've included a manual data entry U/I for it instead.

The single_customer function demonstrates the currying objective based on inheriting
the add_furniture function.  I had to do some modification to add_furniture to make it
work.  The time spent on retrofitting add_furniture did not warrant the supposed
benefit of currying.  Perhaps it would in other contexts?  I can see where currying
might be useful.  But not sure if I would ever use it, unless for some reason I did
not have access to the source code of the function being curried.

I've included a sequence number with each csv record being created.  This is to make the
csv file more like a database with unique 'key'.  The keys manage themselves and have no
U/I (or user meddling either).

The program imports/exports the csv for use inside the program as a dictionary.
